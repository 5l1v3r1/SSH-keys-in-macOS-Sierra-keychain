## Problem
As described in detail on https://openradar.appspot.com/27348363, macOS/OS X till Yosemite used to remember SSH keys added by command `ssh-add -K <key>`.

Unfortunately this way no longer works and the command `ssh-add -K` in macOS Sierra no longer saves SSH keys in the keychain. As Apple Developer stated:

> _"Thatâ€™s expected. We re-aligned our behavior with the mainstream OpenSSH in this area."_

## Solutions


### Solution 1 (recommended)
Apple updated its [Technical Notes] (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2449/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40017589) to indicate that since 10.12.2, macOS includes version 7.3p1 of OpenSSH and its new behaviors.

In `~/.ssh` create `config` file with the following content:

```
Host * (asterisk for all hosts or add specific host)
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile <key> (e.g. ~/.ssh/userKey)
```

### Solution 2
After usage of `ssh-add -K <key>` (it's recommended to use absolute path of keys) call the command `ssh-add -A` on every startup of macOS.

To automate this, add a .plist with the following content to the path `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>Label</key>
	<string>ssh-add-a</string>
	<key>ProgramArguments</key>
	<array>
		<string>ssh-add</string>
		<string>-A</string>
	</array>
	<key>RunAtLoad</key>
	<true/>
</dict>
</plist>

<!-- @@@@LingonWhatStart:ssh-add -A@@@@LingonWhatEnd -->
```

#### Alternatives
- Create this file with [the Lingon app](https://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon/).
- Use `curl` to download the .plist file to the stated path:

    ```bash
    curl -o ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ssh.add.a.plist https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jirsbek/SSH-keys-in-macOS-Sierra-keychain/master/ssh.add.a.plist
    ```

### Notes
If you have issues with `ssh-add: illegal option -- K` after using the `ssh-add -K` command, you may use the full path of the command `/usr/bin/ssh-add`.
